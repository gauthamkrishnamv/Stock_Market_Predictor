📈 Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

A Stock Market Prediction System built with Python, PyQt5, and Machine Learning, designed to assist traders — from beginners to professionals — in making informed trading decisions using LSTM neural networks.

🧠 Overview

The stock market is a dynamic platform where investors buy and sell shares based on availability and market trends. Predicting these trends can help investors minimize risks and maximize profits.
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict future stock prices based on historical data. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, the system analyzes time-series data to forecast future price trends, aiding users to making smarter trading decisions.

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to assist stock traders by providing data-driven predictions from trained ML models.
By minimizing human error and relying on model-based forecasts, the system aims to improve the success rate of trading decisions.

📚 Background
Stock Market;
A stock market is a collective platform of multiple exchanges where investors trade publicly issued shares under defined regulations. It provides profitable opportunities when market trends are properly analyzed and understood. Several exchanges exist at both national and international levels, providing formal venues for these transactions.

Stock Market Prediction (SMP)
  -Stock Market Prediction (SMP) involves predicting future stock trends based on past market data. This process helps investors:
  -Reduce financial risk,
  -Improve confidence in investments,
  -Avoid potential losses,
  -Identify profitable opportunities.
Machine learning algorithms — particularly neural networks — can detect patterns in past stock data and predict future movements, supporting better investment decisions.
